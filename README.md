We are creating a restaurant reservation web application that allows users to book reservations and restaurants to view and manage reservations made at their establishments. The app allows users to log in and view reservations that they have previously created, as well as create new reservations in their name. It also provides functionality for restaurants to log in and manager information about their restaurants and view all the current reservations.
