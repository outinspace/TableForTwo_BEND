### Deploy to the server
Whenever you push your committed code to gitlab, the project will be compiled and copied over to the EC2 server. This process should take 5 minutes or less. You can check the status in the jobs section of the gitlab repo.

### Pushing your changes to gitlab
- Note: Only push your code to gitlab if it compiles and runs. Otherwise, it will be a headache for others when they pull your incomplete changes.

git add .
git commit -m "<INSERT MESSAGE>"
